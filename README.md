## 🧠 How It Works

The game uses **Tkinter buttons** arranged in a 3x3 grid.  
Each button represents a cell — players click alternately as "X" or "O".  
After every move, the program:

1. Checks all possible winning combinations.  
2. Highlights the winning cells in green if found.  
3. Declares a draw if all cells are filled without a winner.  
4. Offers to restart or exit the game.
